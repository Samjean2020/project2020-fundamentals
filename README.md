                                                                Project Statement

In this project you must perform and explain simple linear regression using Python on the powerproduction dataset available on Moodle. The goal is to accurately predict wind turbine power output from wind speed values using the data set as a basis. Your submission must be in the form of a git repository containing, at a minimum, the following items:
1.	Jupyter notebook that performs simple linear regression on the data set.
2.	In that notebook, an explanation of your regression and an analysis of its accuracy.
3.	Standard items in a git repository such as a README. To enhance your submission, you might consider comparing simple linear regression to other types of regression on this data set.

				                                                        Introduction

The goal of this project is to accurately predict wind turbine power output from wind speed values using the dataset powerproduction as a basis. Explanation and performing simple linear regression is needed. 
               		                                              About the dataset powerproduction

This dataset is available on Moodle at the URL provided on Jupyter Notebook. Powerproduction dataset has two variables speed and power. Both are numeric variables with numerical values. They have 500 entries or rows. 

                                                                Prerequisites
Have Python standard imports, including Numpy for mathematics or numerical operations; Matplotlib.pyplot for plotting; Pandas for data manipulation and analysis; Seaborn for data visualisation; Scikit.learn or Sklearn module for machine learning and data mining and regression in particular, Jupyter Notebook for text, code, and visualisations; and Python programming language for the execution of all instructions.
 				                                                        
                                                                Regression explanation and analysis
                                                                                                 
The regression explanation analysis part contains regression explanation, analysis and steps on how I proceeded. These include: defining and concepts on simple linear regression, about dataset powerproduction.csv, relationship between speed and power, and plotting ("powerproduction.csv") dataset as a whole. It also includes selection of both variables values from ("powerproduction.csv") dataset, coefficient and model and fit it, coefficient, and plotting to get simple linear regression on selected values. Model and fit it, calculations, predictions, predicting wind turbine power(y) output from wind speed (x) values, and plotting predictions histogram to see their distribution are included. Comparing simple linear regression and curve regression using data simulation, and a try to fit the above plot into a curve-regression using poly.fit_transform () function are part of the analysis. Each part as mentioned-above is undertaken in Python code and their outputs are explained throughout the Jupyter notebook. 
				
                                                                Conclusion

No relationships have been noticed throughout this research between speed and power as per dataset provided.  Selected data from the dataset provided predictions on wind turbine power(y) output from wind speed (x) values as explained on the Jupyter Notebook. No increase of power production when speed is in increase.
